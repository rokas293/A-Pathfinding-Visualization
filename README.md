## Introduction

The A* algorithm is an informed search algorithm that efficiently finds the shortest path between two points on a graph. It uses a heuristic function to guide the search process, making it particularly effective in situations where the search space is large.

This project provides a visual representation of the A* algorithm in action, allowing users to interactively create obstacles, specify start and end points, and observe how the algorithm finds the shortest path around obstacles.

## Features

- Interactive grid-based visualization.
- Ability to add barriers and specify start and end points.
- Real-time visualization of the A* algorithm finding the shortest path.
- Reset functionality to clear the grid and start over.

## Controls

- Left-click: Add/remove barrier or specify start/end points.
- Right-click: Reset a cell to its default state.
- Spacebar: Run the A* algorithm to find the shortest path.
- 'C' key: Clear the grid and reset all settings.
